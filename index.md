## Welcome to PolarFire SoC

PolarFire SoC Industryâ€™s First RISC-V SoC FPGA Architecture Brings Real-Time to Linux, Giving Developers the Freedom to Innovate in Low-Power, Secure and Reliable Designs

## Quick start
To try PolarFire SoC, you can use the [icicle kit] (link). Icicle kit comes with a PolarFire SoC FPGA device pre-programmed with a reference design and linux image pre-programmed with it. To quickly start using icicle kit, follow the instructions [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#getting-started) and you will see Linux booting up on the icicle kit Out Of the Box.

To upgrade the SoC FPGA design running on your icicle kit, download the design files from [here]() and follow the instructions [here]() to program it on your icicle kit
