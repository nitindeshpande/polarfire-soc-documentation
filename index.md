## Welcome to PolarFire SoC

PolarFire SoC is Industryâ€™s First RISC-V SoC FPGA Architecture Brings Real-Time to Linux, Giving Developers the Freedom to Innovate in Low-Power, Secure and Reliable Designs

## Quick start
To try PolarFire SoC, you can use the [icicle kit] (https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#hardware) hardware platform. Icicle kit comes with a PolarFire SoC FPGA device pre-programmed with a reference design and linux image. To start using Icicle kit, follow the instructions [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#getting-started) and power it up to see Linux booting up on the icicle kit.

To upgrade the SoC FPGA design running on your icicle kit, download the design files from [here](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/icicle-kit-reference-design/releases) and follow the instructions [here]() to program it on your icicle kit
To upgrade the Linux images with the latest available
