## Welcome to PolarFire SoC

PolarFire SoC is Industryâ€™s First RISC-V SoC FPGA Architecture bringing Real-Time capability to Linux, enabling the freedom to innovate in _Low-Power_, _Secure_ and _reliable_ programmable solutions.

## Quick start
To start exploring and evaluating PolarFire SoC features, you can start using the [icicle kit](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#hardware) hardware platform. The PolarFire SoC FPGA device on the icicle kit is pre-programmed with a SoC FPGA reference design and a yocto linux image. Follow the [instructions](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#getting-started) and power up the icicle kit to see Linux booting up out of the box.

### Updating the pre-programmed FPGA design and the linux image
The PolarFire SoC FPGA reference design and the linux image get updated and released on github regularly. To upgrade the PolarFire SoC FPGA design running on your icicle kit,  [download](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/icicle-kit-reference-design/releases) the reference design programming file and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md#programming-the-polarfire-soc-design) to program it on your kit.

To upgrade the Yocto Linux image running on your icicle kit with the latest available pre-built images, [download](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/releases) and follow the [istructions](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md#programming-the-linux-image) to program it on your kit.
