## Welcome to PolarFire SoC

PolarFire SoC is Industryâ€™s First RISC-V SoC FPGA Architecture Brings Real-Time to Linux, Giving Developers the Freedom to Innovate in Low-Power, Secure and Reliable Designs

## Quick start
To explore PolarFire SoC, you can start using the [icicle kit](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#hardware) hardware platform. It comes with a PolarFire SoC FPGA device pre-programmed with a reference design and yocto linux image. Follow the instructions [**here**](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#getting-started) and power up the icicle kit to see Linux booting up out of the box.

### Updating the pre-programmed reference design and linux images
The PolarFire SoC FPGA reference design and the linux image get updated and released on github regularly. To upgrade the PolarFire SoC FPGA design running on your icicle kit,  [download](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/icicle-kit-reference-design/releases) the reference design programming file and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md#programming-the-polarfire-soc-design) to program it on your kit.

To upgrade the Yocto Linux image running on your icicle kit with the latest available pre-built images, [download](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/releases) and follow the [istructions](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md#programming-the-linux-image) to program it on your kit.
