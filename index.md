## Welcome to PolarFire SoC

PolarFire SoC is Industryâ€™s First RISC-V SoC FPGA Architecture Brings Real-Time to Linux, Giving Developers the Freedom to Innovate in Low-Power, Secure and Reliable Designs

## Quick start
To explore PolarFire SoC, you can start using the [icicle kit](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#hardware) hardware platform. Icicle kit comes with a PolarFire SoC FPGA device pre-programmed with a reference design and yocto linux image. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide#getting-started) and power up the icicle kit to see Linux booting up out of the box.

### Upgrading to the latest design and linux images
The PolarFire SoC FPGA reference design and the linux image gets updated and released regularly on github. To upgrade the SoC FPGA design running on your icicle kit, download the reference design programming file from [here](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/icicle-kit-reference-design/releases) and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md#programming-the-polarfire-soc-design) to program it on your icicle kit.

To upgrade the Yocto Linux image running on your icicle kit with the latest available pre-built images, download them from from below mentioned paths
